# SVD_model_based_collaborative_filtering
SVD_model_based_collaborative_filtering recommendation engine 

Installation
Anaconda 4.5.11 distribution Python 3.6 
Project Motivation
In this notebook, we implement Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and eplain why the technique falls short for many recommendation problems. However, understanding traditional SVD approaches to matrix factorization is useful as a start to a number of matrix factorization techniques that are possible in practice.

In order to implement SVD for many recommendation engines, we will need to use a slightly modified approach known as FunkSVD. This approach proved to work incredibly well during the Netflix competition, and therefore, it is one of the popular recommendation approaches in use today.
